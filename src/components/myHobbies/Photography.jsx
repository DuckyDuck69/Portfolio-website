      <h3>On-the-vacation activity</h3>
      <p>This is a new hobby to me, only abut 2-3 years old. I picked this up because I wanted to make a moment immortal. I found camera interesting and felt like a witch when using Photosop and Lightroom for the first time, so I decided to buy my own camera and began my journey.</p>
      <p>I chose <a href="https://a.co/d/9pVI7lF">Nikon Z50</a>, an ASPC camera, to be the one to share this journey with me. I chose it because I wanted something versatile: lightweight with a good sensor, 4k capability, and good RAW file for its budget. This beauty caught my eyes.</p>
