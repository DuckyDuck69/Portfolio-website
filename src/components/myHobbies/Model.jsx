      <p>I was a fan of Lego and other building blocks brand since I was a kid. I mainly used them to recreate some of my favorite ships, tanks, planes, spacecrafts, etc.</p>
      <p>Later, I also worked with other type of models than just building blocks. I immersed in Gundam and wood, scale models</p>
      <p>I played lots of warfare game, so you could see I have a lot of historical models in my collection</p>
